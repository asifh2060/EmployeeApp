This section demonstrates how to fetch data from an API and store it in local storage in a React Native application. The data will be retrieved every time the app runs, and the fetched data will be stored locally for offline access.

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server
npm install
npm start


## Step 2: Start your Application


### For Android

npm run android


### For iOS
npm cd ios
npm pod install
npm run ios


This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
